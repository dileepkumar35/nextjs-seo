                            <h3>Overview</h3>
                            <p>Interest, a common Business expenditure, is generally allowed as a deduction while
                                calculating a Taxable Personâ€™s Taxable Income for a Tax Period. However, the
                                deductibility of interest for Corporate Tax purposes is not without limits. It includes
                                interest income and interest expenditure that typically represents amounts paid for use
                                of money or credit, and other associated costs. This is subject to various Corporate Tax
                                provisions, applied in the following order:</p>

                                    <h3>What is &ldquo;Interest&rdquo;?</h3>
                                    <p>The Corporate Tax Law defines the term &ldquo;Interest&rdquo; broadly to reflect
                                        the fact that there is considerable flexibility in how financing arrangements
                                        may be structured, which may be different from the interest recorded for
                                        accounting purposes following the applicable Accounting Standards (i.e. IFRS or
                                        IFRS for SMEs). Taxable Persons will, therefore, be required to identify what
                                        constitutes &ldquo;Interest&rdquo; based on the definition provided under the
                                        Corporate Tax Law<sup><a href='#bookmark2' id='bookmarkback2'>[2]</a></sup>

                                    <p>The recognition of income or expenditure for Corporate Tax purposes follows the
                                        accounting method adopted by the Business, which can be either the Accrual Basis
                                        of Accounting or the Cash Basis of Accounting.</p>
                                    <p>Under the Accrual Basis of Accounting, income or expenditure is generally
                                        recognised when it is earned or incurred, regardless of when the payment is
                                        made.</p>
                                    <p>In the case of a Cash Basis of Accounting (allowed only where Taxable Personâ€™s

                                        expenditure is accounted only when the payment is actually made.</p>
                                    <p>Any income or expenditure that is treated as Interest will adopt the accounting
                                        method followed by the Business, except for capitalised interest (see <a

                            <h3>Discounts and premiums</h3>
                            <p>Discounts and premiums are treated as Interest when they are related to the borrowing of
                                money or the issuance of debt instruments because they represent the cost of borrowing
                                or return on lending.</p>
                            <p>When a bond or debt instrument is issued at a price lower than its face value, the
                                difference between the issue price and the face value is known as a
                                &ldquo;discount&rdquo;. This may occur where the bond pays no interest (zero coupon) or
                                the interest rate is below the market rate. This discount (which may be amortised over
                                the term of the debt instrument) is treated as Interest. For example, a company issues a
                                bond with a face value of AED 10,000 at a price of AED 9,500. The discount of AED 500
                                (which may be amortised over the term of the debt instrument) is considered to be
                                Interest income for the lender (the holder) and Interest expenditure for the borrower
                                (the issuer).</p>
                            <p>When a bond or debt instrument is issued for more than its face value, the excess amount
                                is referred to as a &ldquo;premium&rdquo;. This may occur where the bond pays a rate of
                                Interest higher than the prevailing market rate. This premium (which may be amortised
                                over the term of the debt instrument) is considered to represent the lenderâ€™s reward for
                                the loan of money and is, therefore, treated as Interest.</p>
                            <p>For example, a bond with a face value of AED 10,000 is subscribed at a market price of
                                AED 10,200. The issuer (the borrower) must pay back AED 10,000 to the holder (the
                                lender) being the face value of the bond. For the holder (the lender), the AED 200
                                premium is typically amortised and recognised in the income statement over the term of
                                the bond, which will be treated as Interest expenditure whereas for the issuer (the
                                borrower), the AED 200 is amortised over the term of the bond as a reduction to its
                                Interest expenditure (i.e. it is considered as Interest income).</p>
                            <p>Discounts provided as sales incentives or for early payment are not considered Interest,
                                as they are not related to the financing or borrowing of money. Other examples of
                                discounts and premium that are not considered to be Interest include:</p>

                            <p>Islamic Financial Instruments<sup><a href='#bookmark5' id='bookmarkback5'>[5]</a></sup>
                                are designed to facilitate financial transactions, while adhering to Sharia principles,
                                which prohibit Interest. Common examples of Islamic financing structures used to offer
                                sharia-compliant products are Mudarabah, Murabaha, Ijara, Sukuk, etc.</p>
                            <p>Such instruments typically contain an element (such as &ldquo;profit&rdquo; or
                                &ldquo;mark-up&rdquo;) that is considered to be economically equivalent to Interest,
                                regardless of the classification and treatment of the element under IFRS (or IFRS for
                                SMEs).<sup><a href='#bookmark6' id='bookmarkback6'>[6]</a></sup></p>
                            <p>An Islamic Financial Instrument (or a combination of arrangements that form part of the
                                same Islamic Financial Instrument) that is classified as an ownership interest under the
                                Accounting Standards issued by the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic
                                Financial Institutions (&ldquo;AAOIFI&rdquo;) is not considered to have an Interest
                                element.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, in order to determine how these Islamic Financial Instruments should be
                                treated for Corporate Tax purposes, it is necessary to understand how these instruments
                                have been treated as per IFRS. For example, if the instrument is recognised as a debt
                                instrument in accordance with IFRS, the corresponding profit distribution should be
                                considered as equivalent to Interest for the purposes of the Interest limitation rules.
                                Conversely, if the instrument is not classified as a debt instrument under IFRS, there
                                would be no Interest equivalent element. For example, a profit distribution in respect
                                of an instrument that is recognised as a debt in accordance with IFRS, such profit
                                distribution should be considered as equivalent to Interest for the purposes of the
                                Interest limitation rules.</p>
                            <p>Below are examples of Islamic Financial Instruments and the corresponding Interest
                                equivalent element (assuming they are classified as a debt instrument under IFRS).</p>

                                    <p>A <b>Mudarabah </b>is a contractual relationship executed between two parties,

                                        agent or manager, for investment purposes. Each party is granted a ratio of any
                                        earnings, determined at the time of making the investment. Such earnings would
                                        be typically treated as Interest equivalent for Corporate Tax purposes.</p>

                                    <p>In a <b>Murabaha </b>cost-plus financing structure, a bank purchases an asset and

                                        on a deferred payment basis. The payments (which consist of principal plus

                                    <p><strong>Ijara </strong><span>or Islamic leasing, is a Shariah-compliant financial
                                            structure where the lessor (financier) leases an asset to the lessee
                                            (borrower) for a specified period in exchange for rental payments. The
                                            ownership of the asset remains with the lessor, who also bears the risks
                                            associated with ownership, such as maintenance and insurance. Generally, in
                                            asset-based financing, the ownership of the asset is eventually transferred
                                            to the lessee at the end of the lease term, often for a nominal or minimal
                                            payment. The rental payments made by the lessee to the lessor can be fixed
                                            or variable, often linked to a benchmark rate, allowing for flexibility in
                                            adjusting payments over time. The rental payments include both a profit and
                                            principal element. The profit element may be considered as akin to Interest
                                            for Corporate Tax purposes (after adjustment for implied maintenance charges
                                            for the asset (if any)).</span></p>

                                        profits as per the agreed mark-up. The mark-up element is typically considered
                                        as akin to Interest. In other structures, instead of fixed distribution
                                        payments, investors may receive income from a &ldquo;right of use&rdquo; asset,

                            <p>The concept of &quot;payments economically equivalent to Interest&quot; encompasses a
                                wide array of financial charges that, although not explicitly labelled as Interest,
                                fulfil a similar economic role. These payments may occur within transactions or
                                arrangements where the term 'Interest' has not been used but the economic substance of

                                    <p>A debt instrument is a contract where a person (the lender) provides money (the

                                        lender at specified intervals or upon maturity.</p>
                                    <p>A performing debt instrument is where the borrower is making payments of interest
                                        and/or repayments of the principal amount on the previously agreed dates. The
                                        interest that is paid is treated as Interest expenditure for the borrower and
                                        Interest income for the lender.</p>
                                    <p>On the other hand, a non-performing debt instrument is where the borrower is not
                                        making the previously agreed payments. For the borrower, any penalties or higher
                                        interest charges resulting from the default is treated as Interest expenditure
                                        as well as the &quot;standard&quot; interest that it owes. For the lender, any
                                        amount receivable from the borrower that is not in respect of a repayment of the
                                        principal amount, is treated as Interest income.</p>
                                    <p>A provision or write-off amount in respect of a loan is not considered to be
                                        Interest but depending on the accounting treatment, the amount could be a
                                        deductible expense for the lender (who has made a loss on the loan) subject to

                                        date. The borrower normally pays a fee to the lender for the use of the
                                        securities.</p>
                                    <p>The fee paid by the borrower to the lender is compensation for the temporary use
                                        of the securities, akin to interest paid on a cash loan. Hence, the return or
                                        profit on a stock lending transaction is treated as Interest.</p>

                                                the lender</strong></p>
                                        <p>Company D (incorporated and tax resident in the UAE) owns a portfolio of
                                            securities, including blue-chip equities.</p>
                                        <p>Company X (incorporated and tax resident in the UAE), a trading company with
                                            fixed assets, expects that the market value of those blue-chip equities is
                                            going to fall. It, therefore, wants to short sell those equities, that is,
                                            sell the equities and then buy them back at a lower price, in order to make
                                            a profit.</p>
                                        <p>Company D and Company X enter into an agreement whereby Company D lends to
                                            Company X its blue-chip equities which are worth AED 20 million at that
                                            time, for a period of 90 days. Under the agreement, Company D will charge
                                            Company X a fee of AED 98,630, which is the equivalent of an annualised
                                            lending fee of 2% (20,000,000 * 2% * 90/365). Since Company X intends to
                                            short sell the equities and there is no guarantee that it will be able to
                                            repurchase those equities to return to Company D, it places some fixed
                                            assets as collateral with Company D.</p>
                                        <p>During the 90-day lending period, Company X, as the legal holder of the
                                            equities, receives a Dividend of AED 500,000 in respect of the equities.
                                            Under the agreement, Company X should forward any Dividend income to Company
                                            D (that is, the amount of Dividend received is not part of or factored into
                                            pricing of the arrangement).</p>
                                        <p>At the end of the 90 days, Company X returns the equities it borrowed to
                                            Company D and Company D returns the collateral to Company X. In addition,
                                            Company X pays AED 598,630 to Company D. This amount is in respect of the
                                            lending fee of AED 98,630 and the AED 500,000 Dividend receipt.</p>
                                        <p>For Company D (the lender), the fee of AED 98,630 is considered to be
                                            Interest income. Where the Dividend receipt of AED 500,000 retains its
                                            characteristic as Dividend income for Company D (following applicable
                                            accounting standards IFRS or IFRS for SMEs), this may be considered as
                                            Exempt Income (if all conditions are met) for Corporate Tax Purposes.</p>
                                        <p>For Company X (the borrower), the fee of AED 98,630 is considered to be
                                            Interest expenditure. Although it received a Dividend of AED 500,000, this
                                            is not subject to tax for Company X because it passes this income to Company
                                            D. However, any profit or loss made from the short selling of the equities
                                            is subject to tax in accordance with the accounting treatment and the
                                            Corporate Tax rules.</p>
                                        <p>Accordingly, the Dividend shall not be considered as a part of the Interest
                                            component.</p>

                                    <h3>Securitisation involving transfer of assets in exchange for securities<sup><a

                                    <p>Securitisation is the process of taking an asset or a group of assets and
                                        transforming those assets into an investable security. The process typically
                                        involves a special purpose vehicle (SPV) issuing securities to investors in
                                        exchange for cash. The SPV uses that cash to purchase assets that generate cash
                                        flows, for example, loans or receivables, such as mortgages, credit card
                                        receivables, auto (car) loans, or other types of debt. The cash flows typically
                                        include an interest component and, therefore, the economic substance of a
                                        securitisation transaction is similar to that of a loan arrangement between the
                                        investor and ultimate borrower.</p>
                                    <p>The securities that are issued to the investors represent claims on the cash
                                        flows produced by the underlying assets, so although an investor may be
                                        receiving a return on a security, the investor is treated as receiving Interest
                                        income (rather than a Dividend), to the extent that the return is derived from a
                                        cash flow with an interest component. For the SPV that has issued the
                                        securities, the return on the underlying assets (excluding capital repayment) as
                                        well as the payment to investors represents compensation for the use of funds (a
                                        financing arrangement) and is treated as Interest expense.</p>
                                    <div class='example'>
                                        <p><strong>Example 8: Securitisation of auto loans</strong></p>
                                        <p>A Bank wishes to dispose of a portfolio of auto (car) loans that it holds.
                                            The ultimate borrowers (who have purchased the cars) make monthly payments
                                            of interest as well as principal repayments.</p>
                                        <p>The Bank sets up a special purpose vehicle (SPV). Neither the Bank nor the
                                            SPV is an Exempt Person for Corporate Tax purposes.</p>
                                        <p>The SPV purchases the auto loans from Bank and then issues securities to
                                            investors. The monthly payments made by the ultimate borrowers are paid to
                                            the investors via the SPV.</p>
                                        <p>The payments made to the investors that represent a return on their
                                            investment (payment of interest by the borrowers to the bank which is
                                            ultimately paid to the SPV) is considered to be Interest.</p>

                                    <p>There are different types of contracts whereby one party (the lessor) conveys an
                                        asset to another (the lessee) for a specified time, usually in return for a
                                        periodic payment.</p>
                                    <p>Three such contracts are considered below: hire purchase, finance lease, and non-
                                        finance lease (also known as operating lease). Further, a &ldquo;sale and
                                        leaseback&rdquo; transaction could be either a finance lease or non-finance
                                        lease (see <a href='#bookmarkSection3.5.8'>section 3.5.8</a>), depending on the
                                        contractual terms.</p>
                                    <p>Under a hire purchase contract, the lessee has the option to purchase the asset
                                        at the end of the contract term. Ownership of the asset is transferred from the
                                        lessor to the lessee after all payments have been made. Such payments include
                                        those related to purchasing the asset at the end of the hire purchase period.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Under a finance lease contract, legal title of the asset remains with the lessor
                                        but the lease term usually covers a significant portion of the asset's useful
                                        life. The lessee typically assumes most of the risks and rewards of ownership of
                                        the asset, and is, for example, responsible for maintenance, insurance and other
                                        costs associated with the asset. The finance lease payments are typically
                                        structured to cover the full cost of the asset plus a financing charge over the
                                        lease term, which is similar to a loan repayment schedule.</p>
                                    <p>For both hire purchase and finance lease contracts, the lessee typically makes
                                        regular payments that cover both the cost of the leased asset and financing
                                        charge (associated with the lease liability) over the contract term. The lessee
                                        may be required under IFRS (or IFRS for SMEs) to record its &ldquo;right of
                                        use&rdquo; as an asset. If an asset is recorded, the financing charge is
                                        Interest expenditure.16 If IFRS (or IFRS for SMEs) requires the lessor to record
                                        a finance element in respect of the contract, that finance element is Interest
                                        income.</p>

                                    <p>A non-finance lease, commonly referred to as an operating lease, is an
                                        arrangement where the lessor allows the lessee to use an asset for a specific
                                        period in exchange for rental payments. Unlike a finance lease, an operating
                                        lease does not provide the lessee with all the benefits and risks typically
                                        associated with ownership of the asset.</p>
                                    <p>A non-finance lease is still considered to have a finance element that represents
                                        the cost of funding, and that finance element is treated as Interest.<sup><a

                                    <p>For the lessee, where there is a right-of-use asset, there should be a finance
                                        element for accounting purposes, and this finance element is considered to be
                                        Interest.</p>
                                    <p>For the lessor, there would be no finance element for accounting purposes, and
                                        therefore, the finance element, which is considered to be Interest, should be

                                    <p>A business may sell goods or services to customers on credit such that customers
                                        need only pay later. Those customers may be referred to as &ldquo;debtors&rdquo;
                                        and the amounts they owe may be referred to as &ldquo;accounts

                                        flow or working capital purposes. Instead of taking out a loan to cover the
                                        period before the debtors make their payments, the business could sell the
                                        accounts receivable.</p>
                                    <p>Factoring is where a business sells its accounts receivable to another party,
                                        known as a &ldquo;factor&rdquo;, usually at a discount or &ldquo;factoring
                                        fee&rdquo;. The factor then assumes the responsibility for collecting the
                                        payments from the business's customers (the debtors). There are two types of
                                        factoring arrangements:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>In a &ldquo;recourse&rdquo; factoring arrangement, the business retains
                                                the risk of non- payment by its debtors. So, if the debtor fails to pay,
                                                the factor can demand repayment from the seller. In this situation, the
                                                seller will suffer a bad debt expense, which may be a deductible expense
                                                (under the general principles of deductibility for Corporate Tax
                                                purposes).</p>

                                        <li>
                                            <p>In a &ldquo;non-recourse&rdquo; factoring arrangement, the credit risk of
                                                non-payment is assumed by the factor. So, if the debtor fails to pay,
                                                the factor cannot seek repayment from the business. In this situation,
                                                the factor will suffer the bad debt expense, which may be deductible

                                    <p>Given the differences in risks, the factoring fee is typically higher for
                                        non-recourse factoring compared to recourse factoring arrangements. Factoring is
                                        effectively a financing transaction and, therefore, the factoring fee, i.e.
                                        discount or any other Interest-like component, is treated as Interest at the
                                        time it is recognised under IFRS (or IFRS for SMEs).</p>

                            <p>Foreign exchange movement refers to the change in the value of one currency relative to

                                liabilities, income, or expenses denominated in a foreign currency.</p>
                            <p>Any foreign exchange gains or losses that are related to Interest or other payments
                                economically equivalent to interest are considered to be Interest.<sup><a

                                Interest, for example, on the sale of finished products or the purchase of raw
                                materials, should not be considered as Interest.</p>

                                <p>Company P (incorporated and tax resident in the UAE) has a Financial Year end of 30
                                    June. It takes out a loan of 1 million Singapore Dollars (SGD) on 1 January 2024.
                                    The annual interest rate on the loan is 5%.</p>
                                <p>The interest of SGD 50,000 is due to be paid on 1 June 2024 but Company P actually

                                <p>On 30 June 2024, the exchange rate is AED 2.60 : SGD 1</p>

                                <p>Thus, on 30 June 2024, an accrual is created for the interest payable of AED 130,000
                                    (SGD 50,000 * 2.60) while on 30 September 2024, Company P actually pays interest of
                                    AED 132,500 (SGD 50,000 * 2.65).</p>
                                <p>The Interest expenditure for the Tax Period ending on 30 June 2024 is AED 130,000.
                                    For the Tax Period ending on 30 June 2025, the Interest expenditure includes the

                                <p>The foreign exchange movement on the principal portion of the loan is also taken into

                            <p>Generally, borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition,
                                construction or production of an asset are capitalised based on IFRS (or IFRS for SMEs).
                                Where capitalisation is appropriate, interest, processing fees and any other costs
                                incurred in obtaining a loan to construct a long-term asset is added to the cost base of
                                the asset rather than being immediately expensed in the income statement under IFRS (or
                                IFRS for SMEs).</p>
                            <p>Capitalised interest is not deductible in the Tax Period in which it is incurred because
                                it is capital in nature.<sup><a href='#bookmark23' id='bookmarkback23'>[23]</a></sup>
                                Instead, it should be treated as part of the cost of the related asset and, therefore,
                                increases the cost base of that asset for depreciation purposes.</p>
                            <p>Income and expenditure attributable to the capitalised interest amount is subject to the
                                General Interest Deduction Limitation Rule.<sup><a href='#bookmark24'
                                        id='bookmarkback24'>[24]</a></sup> Any amount of income and expenditure
                                attributable to capitalised interest in accordance with the Accounting Standards
                                followed by the Taxable Person (i.e. IFRS or IFRS for SMEs) should be treated as part of
                                Net Interest Expenditure in the Tax Period in which the capitalised interest is
                                amortised over the useful life of the related asset, and not in the Tax Period in which
                                the interest is incurred and capitalised.<sup><a href='#bookmark25'
                                        id='bookmarkback25'>[25]</a></sup></p>

                                (or IFRS for SMEs), the Taxable Person must make the following adjustments when
                                calculating Net Interest Expenditure and adjusted EBITDA:</p>
                            <ol type='a'>

                                    <p>Net Interest Expenditure - the capitalised interest should be spread on a
                                        straight- line basis over the useful life of the underlying asset, and the
                                        relevant portion for each Tax Period should be included in Net Interest
                                        Expenditure.</p>

                                    <p>Adjusted EBITDA - to avoid double-counting, the amount of depreciation that is
                                        added back when calculating adjusted EBITDA should be reduced by the amount
                                        included in Net Interest Expenditure under (a) above because that amount is re-
                                        characterised from being depreciation to being Interest in that Tax Period.</p>
                                </li>

                                been fully included in Net Interest Expenditure, the balance of the capitalised interest
                                should be treated as part of Net Interest Expenditure in the Tax Period in which the
                                asset is disposed of.</p>

                                    year as its Financial Year and Tax Period. It decided to build a machine in the UAE
                                    to manufacture drinks. To fund the machine, Company Q obtained a bank loan in its
                                    2025 Tax Period of AED 10 million for a period of 1 year at an annual interest rate
                                    of 10% with an agreement that the principal will be repaid at the start of year 2.
                                    Company Q also paid the bank AED 200,000 in loan processing fees.</p>
                                <p>Based on the applicable Accounting Standards followed by Company Q, the following
                                    amounts were capitalised in the year ended 31 December 2025:</p>

                                <p>The cost of the machine recorded in the Financial Statements at 31 December 2025 is
                                    AED 11.2 million. The machine was brought into use on 1 January 2026.</p>
                                <p>The useful life of the machine was estimated to be 10 years. However, Company Q
                                    decides to apply a rate of 15% applying the diminishing value approach for
                                    depreciation. Accordingly, during the 2026 Tax Period, a depreciation charge of AED
                                    1,680,000 (15%*11.2 million) is recorded in the income statement.</p>

                                    AED 1 million and loan processing fees of AED 200,000) is amortised on a

                                <p>Accordingly, for Tax Period 2026, AED 120,000 is treated to be Interest while
                                    computing Net Interest Expenditure, and the same amount is excluded from
                                    depreciation while computing adjusted EBITDA.</p>

                                        service providers, can result in additional charges, which can take the form of
                                        late payment fees or interest charges.</p>
                                    <p>Unless the charges are specified as a fine or penalty in a relevant contract,
                                        such charges should be considered to be compensation to the creditor for the
                                        delayed use of funds that were due to them. Accordingly, these charges should be
                                        treated as Interest.</p>
                                    <p>For example, if a company has agreed to payment terms with a supplier that
                                        include a charge at a rate of 1% per month on overdue invoice balances, and the
                                        company fails to pay an invoice on time, the additional amount charged should be
                                        treated as Interest. On the other hand, if the charge on overdue invoice
                                        balances is a one-off fixed penalty amount of say AED 10,000 regardless of when
                                        the overdue invoice is paid, the AED 10,000 would not be considered Interest.

                            <p>The term &quot;amounts incurred in connection with raising finance&quot; refers to the

                                other financial instruments (other than equity instruments). These costs are considered
                                to be Interest.<sup><a href='#bookmark30' id='bookmarkback30'>[30]</a></sup></p>

                                    <p>Derivative contracts are not specifically defined but include financial contracts
                                        between two or more parties that derive their value from one or more underlying
                                        asset. They include forward contracts, futures contract, options, and swap
                                        agreements. These contracts may be used as a way of raising finance but they are
                                        more typically used to hedge risks connected with the raising of finance. For
                                        example, a company that has taken a variable interest rate loan could
                                        effectively fix the interest rate through an interest rate swap agreement.</p>
                                    <p>Any interest component of a derivative contract is considered to be Interest.
                                        <sup><a href='#bookmark36' id='bookmarkback36'>[36]</a></sup> The
                                        &ldquo;interest component&rdquo; would follow the interest or other financing
                                        amount or gain or loss taken to the income statement under IFRS (or IFRS for

                            <p>Where a debt instrument is disposed, sold or transferred, it may result in a gain or
                                loss. Such gain or loss is considered as Interest to the extent it is treated as
                                interest or other financing amount under IFRS (or IFRS for SMEs).</p>
                            <p>For example, a company that has invested in interest-bearing corporate bonds decides to
                                sell these bonds before they mature. It realises a loss and records all of this as a
                                loss on disposal of financial assets (not interest expense). Accordingly, no element of
                                this loss is treated as Interest. However, that loss is included in Accounting Income
                                and, therefore, brought into the Taxable Income calculation.<sup><a href='#bookmark37'

                            <p>Another example would be where a real estate company sells a property for an agreed sale
                                price of AED 1 million. Instead of the buyer paying for the property in one lump sum,
                                however, the company agrees that the buyer can pay for the property in six instalment
                                payments of AED 200,000 over two years. The total amount received is, therefore, AED 1.2
                                million. The additional AED 200,000 over the sale price is recorded as Interest income
                                for the real estate company. Each instalment payment would have an Interest element of
                                AED 33,333 (being AED 200,000 / 6).</p>

                            <h3>General principles of deductibility of expenditure</h3>
                            <p>In general, Business expenditure is allowed as a deduction while calculating the Taxable
                                Income of a Taxable Person if it is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of
                                the Taxable Person's Business and is not capital in nature. Such expenses are deductible
                                in the Tax Period in which they are incurred. What constitutes &ldquo;expenditure&rdquo;
                                generally follows the accounting classification and measurement per the Financial
                                Statements that have been prepared in accordance with IFRS (or IFRS for SMEs) and,
                                therefore, the Accounting Income figure within the income statement is the starting
                                point when calculating Taxable Income.<sup><a href='#bookmark41'
                                        id='bookmarkback41'>[41]</a></sup></p>
                            <p>However, for Corporate Tax purposes, additional rules apply such that expenditure that is
                                recognised as such for accounting purposes may not be deductible when calculating
                                Taxable Income (see <a href='#bookmarkSection4.2.1'>Section 4.2.1</a>). Such rules also
                                apply to Interest expenditure.</p>
                            <p>There are specific adjustments to be made items of expenditure in line with the following
                                rules:<sup><a href='#bookmark42' id='bookmarkback42'>[42]</a></sup></p>

                                        the Taxable Person's Business or is incurred for more than one purpose, all or
                                        part of the expenditure must be added back to the Accounting Income figure when

                                    <p>For instance, if a company takes out a loan and the money is used to buy a

                                        property is not used for Business purposes, any Interest related to that loan is

                                        statement of the company.</p>
                                    <p>If expenditure is incurred for more than one purpose, the portion of the

                                <p>Ms U charges Company T an interest rate of 8% on the loan even though the market

                            <p>The Specific Interest Deduction Limitation Rule is a targeted provision designed to
                                prevent the erosion of the Corporate Tax base. This could be achieved through the use of
                                certain financial transactions between Taxable Persons and their Related Parties. For
                                example, transactions could be carried out for the sole or main purpose of creating
                                deductible Interest expenditure, while the Interest income derived may not be subject to
                                tax.<sup><a href='#bookmark56' id='bookmarkback56'>[56]</a></sup></p>
                            <p>This Specific Interest Deduction Limitation Rule applies after the application of the

                                    <p>No Corporate Tax advantage is deemed to arise where the Related Party is subject
                                        to Corporate Tax, or a tax of a similar character to Corporate Tax under the

                                    <p>If the Interest income is subject to an effective tax rate of less than 9% in the
                                        foreign jurisdiction of the Non-Resident Person (for example, the statutory rate
                                        is less than 9% or the income is exempt or enjoys preferential tax treatment
                                        that results in tax of less than 9%), the presumption will not apply. The

                                            Corporate Tax purposes to the armâ€™s length rate, so from AED 1.4 million (20

                                            disallowed Interest expenditure. This amount cannot be carried forward

                                        <p>When applying the Specific Interest Deduction Limitation Rule, no Corporate
                                            Tax advantage is deemed to arise on the basis that Company Q is subject to
                                            tax at an effective rate of not less than 9% and, therefore, the AED 1
                                            million of Interest expenditure is not further disallowed.</p>
                                        <p>However, Company P will still need to consider whether the General Interest
                                            Deduction Limitation Rule would apply to disallow any of the AED 1 million

                                        <p>Year ended 31 December 2024:</p>

                                            30 December 2024. For UAE Corporate Tax purposes, Company R has a permanent
                                            establishment and is a Non-Resident Person, i.e. a Taxable Person with a
                                            2024 Tax Period.</p>
                                        <p>Company R incurred Interest expenditure of AED 16 million in relation to its
                                            Permanent Establishment. Its adjusted EBITDA is AED 2 million.</p>
                                        <p>Applying the General Interest Deduction Limitation Rule, the deductible Net

                                        <p>Accordingly, Company R can deduct Net Interest Expenditure up to AED 12
                                            million while calculating its Taxable Income for the 2024 Tax Period. The

                                        <p>For the years ended 31 December 2025 and 2026:</p>
                                        <p>Company Râ€™s construction project is completed in 2024 and it has no other

                                        <p>For the year ended 31 December 2027:</p>

                                            July 2027 to 31 December 2027, thereby creating a Permanent Establishment in
                                            the UAE. Accordingly, Company R will be treated as a Taxable Person for the

                                        <p>When calculating its Taxable Income for the 2027 Tax Period, and in applying
                                            the General Interest Deduction Limitation Rule, Company R cannot take into
                                            account the excess unutilised Net Interest Expenditure of AED 4 million
                                            related to its previous Permanent Establishment, despite being within the

                                    <p>Taxable Persons that earn Revenue that does not exceed AED 3 million in a Tax
                                        Period may use the Cash Basis of Accounting.<sup><a href='#bookmark103'

                                        exceeds AED 3 million in a Tax Period, they must prepare Financial Statements
                                        using the Accrual Basis of Accounting, except under exceptional circumstances
                                        and following the FTAâ€™s approval.<sup><a href='#bookmark104'
                                                id='bookmarkback104'>[104]</a></sup> The Revenue amount must be
                                        calculated in line with the armâ€™s length standard.</p>
                                    <p>Under the Cash Basis of Accounting, income and expenditure is recognised when
                                        cash payments are actually received or paid.</p>
                                    <p>For example, if a Taxable Person (with a Gregorian calendar year Tax Period)
                                        following the Cash Basis of Accounting, lends money in 2024 but only receives
                                        interest income in 2025, that interest income should be included in the Revenue
                                        of the 2025 Tax Period. Similarly, if the Taxable Person takes out a loan and
                                        makes interest payments in the 2025 Tax Period, such interest payments, if
                                        deductible for Corporate Tax purposes, should be included in the expenditure of
                                        the 2025 Tax Period even if the interest payments fell due in either 2024 or
                                        2026.</p>

                                        should be deducted when calculating Taxable Income for the Tax Period in which

                                            <p>A project that is exclusively for the public benefit is one that benefits
                                                a large subset of the public, as opposed to the private interests of
                                                investors, companies or a small group not otherwise in need. For
                                                example, a project to build a hospital that may be used by both expats
                                                and Emirati citizens, with or without private medical insurance, would
                                                qualify. On the other hand, a project to build a hospital for the
                                                exclusive use of a specific family would not.</p>
                                            <p>The word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; means that there can be no part of the
                                                project that would not be for public benefit. So, for example, a project
                                                to build a hospital that may be used by the public but also includes a
                                                private wing for the exclusive use of a specific family who donated
                                                funds to the project would not qualify, even if that private wing could
                                                be considered to be an incidental part of the overall hospital.</p>

                                                educational experience for students. Here, although the company is
                                                disposing of an asset, it is essentially replacing an asset rather than

                            <p>A Taxable Person that is a Resident Person may elect for Small Business Relief in respect
                                of a Tax Period if certain conditions are met, including where the Revenue of the Person
                                is less than or equal to AED 3 million in that Tax Period and all previous Tax Periods
                                ending on or before 31 December 2026.<sup><a href='#bookmark129'
                                        id='bookmarkback129'>[129]</a></sup></p>
                            <p>If the Small Business Relief election is made for a Tax Period, the Person is treated as
                                not deriving any Taxable Income and, therefore, cannot deduct any Net Interest
                                Expenditure and cannot carry forward any Net Interest Expenditure incurred in the Tax
                                Period to any subsequent Tax Period.<sup><a href='#bookmark130'
                                        id='bookmarkback130'>[130]</a></sup></p>
                            <p>If, however, the Person had Net Interest Expenditure disallowed under the General
                                Interest Deduction Limitation Rule in a previous Tax Period in which an election for
                                Small Business Relief was not made, the Person may carry forward the disallowed amount
                                to subsequent Tax Periods in which an election for Small Business Relief is not made.
                            </p>
                            <p>As discussed in <a href='#bookmarkSection6.2'><a href='#bookmarkSection6.2'>Section
                                        6.2</a></a>, a Taxable Person can carry forward disallowed Net Interest
                                Expenditure for up to 10 Tax Periods. This timeframe ignores the Tax Periods in which
                                the Person elects for Small Business Relief because the previously disallowed Net
                                Interest Expenditure carried forward cannot be utilised during these periods.</p>
                            <p>For example, Company M has disallowed Net Interest Expenditure in its 2024 Tax Period. It
                                did not elect for Small Business Relief in 2024 but it elected for the relief for 2025
                                and 2026 Tax Periods, with Company Mâ€™s Revenue below AED 3 million in all of these Tax
                                Periods. Small Business Relief is not available for Tax Periods after 31 December 2026.
                                Company M can use the Net Interest Expenditure carried forward from 2024 Tax Period up
                                to and including its 2036 Tax Period.</p>
